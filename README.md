# LipNet: Reading Lips with the Power of AI 

Welcome! This project brings to life the fascinating capability of teaching a machine to read lips. Using a deep learning model, this notebook takes a silent video of a person speaking and translates their lip movements directly into text.

It's a demonstration of how far AI has come, moving from understanding just text and images to interpreting the subtle, silent language of human expression.

## Why Does This Matter? The Human Impact

This technology has profound implications for creating a more accessible and connected world.

* **Empowering the Visually Impaired:** Imagine a future where assistive technologies can describe not just the objects in a room, but also what people are saying, even if they can't be heard. This can provide a richer, more complete sense of a social environment, fostering greater connection and understanding.

* **A Bridge for the Hearing Impaired:** For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, this can act as a powerful real-time transcription tool in situations where a sign language interpreter isn't available or in noisy environments where hearing aids struggle.

* **Communication in Silence:** Think of places where silence is golden (like a library) or where noise is overwhelming (like a factory floor). This technology allows for communication without a single sound being uttered.

## Working of Project

This project uses a sophisticated deep neural network to achieve its goal. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process from the notebook:

1.  **Data Preparation:** The model first needs to learn. We feed it video files (`.mpg`) and their corresponding text "alignments" (`.align`). These alignments tell the model exactly which words are being spoken at which moments in the video. The video frames are cropped to focus only on the speaker's mouth and are normalized to make learning easier.

2.  **The Brain of the Operation (The Model):** The model architecture is specifically designed for this task:
    * **3D Convolutional Layers (Conv3D):** Since video is a sequence of images, these layers are perfect for recognizing patterns across both the space of an image (the shape of the lips) and time (how the shape changes).
    * **LSTM Layers (Long Short-Term Memory):** These are the memory cells of our network. They are brilliant at understanding sequences, allowing the model to remember the context of previous lip movements to predict the current word.
    * **CTC Loss Function:** This is a special ingredient. It's a unique loss function that allows the model to train on video and text sequences that don't have the same length, which is crucial since the number of video frames rarely matches the number of characters in a sentence.

3.  **Training and Prediction:** The model is trained on a dataset, learning to associate visual lip patterns with text. Once trained, it can take a completely new video, analyze the lip movements frame by frame, and output its best guess of what is being said.

## Getting Started with this Notebook

Ready to see it in action? Here’s how you can run this project yourself.

### 1. Installation

First, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries. The notebook handles this for you, but if you are setting up the environment manually, use:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib imageio gdown tensorflow
```

### 2. Download the Data

The notebook will automatically download the `GRID` dataset and pre-trained model weights from Google Drive. Just run the cells under the "Build Data Loading Functions" and "Make a Prediction" sections.

### 3. Training the Model

To train the model from scratch, you can run all the cells in the `LipNet.ipynb` notebook sequentially. The notebook will:
* Load and preprocess the data.
* Build the neural network.
* Compile the model with the `CTCLoss` function.
* Begin the training process.

### 4. Making a Prediction

Once model is fully trained, you'll see an output like this, comparing the ground truth with the model's prediction whenever you give a sample test video to it:

```text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ REAL TEXT
'bin p blue'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PREDICTIONS
'bin p blue'
```
